#Problem Statement 
##Subsidiary Distribution Management

* Let's talk benefits before moving to subsidies. State governments across India, at some point in time or other, have announced benefits like cycles, TVs and laptops to its citizens or any subsidy or a payment under any of the schemes(e.g. MGNREGA) But often, these distribution schemes do not reach all the eligible citizens because of various issues.
* Think of a system where items like cycles and laptops are tokenized and distributed via a private ledger and distributed to eligible citizens. The departments related to schemes, the vendor and banks can all be on the blockchain. All data is shared on a common ledger that can be accessed by all parties and cannot be modified without a consensus.
* Create a Blockchain app to create tokens and distribute them to citizens. The app should have smart contracts to control spending of tokens only for a specific purpose. For eg. tokens created for cash subsidy cannot be used to get laptop or cycle etc. The app should also allow for checking the number of tokens given to a particular individual so that an equal distribution is achieved and no one person gets excess tokens.
